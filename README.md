Our application is a world recipe generator. You select which country you come from, which country's cuisine you would like to try. It will display the flags
of both countries, and display a meal from the desired country, including an image of the food, and an embeded youtube video of how to prepare that meal from 
the desired country.

Some of our backend code is in the DjangularPrototype folder. Some of the code that would be added to this was lost, but the general structure of what is in there
now is what our final project backend code would have looked like.

Our new user stories are located in docs. Our old prototype/proposals/user stories are in the main branch.

We added a folder called media. Within this folder is pictures Miles had happened to take of some of the code before we lost it. We hope this can at least show that we 
did have a good amount of frontend work completed. We also have a video of how our first API call working before we lost it. 

The 2 APIS we used were https://countryflagsapi.com/ and https://www.themealdb.com/api.php
The specific details of our application functionality can be found in user stories.

To summarize, our application was able to successfully call both API's and store the data in SQLite, and display the data in Angular. However, the third component,
OAuth, was pretty challenging for us. This was never fully working before we lost our code.
